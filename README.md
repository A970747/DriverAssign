With this app users are able to create drivers and orders to simulate a dispatch scenario. Using a drag-and-drop interface they are able to assign drivers to orders.
This app is live @ https://driveassign.mattjackson.dev/. The front end is written in TypeScript using the NextJS framework with TailwindsCSS for styling, and SWR for data fetching & caching. The backend application is available at https://order-api.mattjackson.dev/api, with /drivers and /orders routes available. The backend is written in TypeScript using NodeJS with Sequelize in front of a PostGresSQL DB. Additionally, the app can be run locally with a
local installation that uses SQLite.
